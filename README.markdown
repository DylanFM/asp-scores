#So...
I love surfing and I'm interested in doing something with all the competition data from the ASP (Association of Surfing Professionals) world tour. Lots of things that can be done. How exciting!

##Here are some example URLS:
* [Heats in a round](http://www.beachbyte.com/live09/rcp09/mr1.asp)
* [Scores for a heat per judge per wave per surfer](http://www.beachbyte.com/live09/rcp09/mr1sc01.asp?rLingua=)
* [Like a wave-by-wave log or transcript for a heat](http://www.beachbyte.com/live09/rcp09/mr1pf01.asp?rLingua=)
